Project Name: Ascendency Core Concept: The world's first free "Looksmaxing" RPG. Vibe: "Solo Leveling" / Futuristic Anime (Dark mode, Neon Blue, System Interfaces).

1. 📱 User Flow & Onboarding Logic
Account Creation: Immediate requirement. Email/Password or Social Auth (Supabase Auth).

The "Hunter" Survey:

Inputs: Height, Age, Weight, Ethnicity, Lifestyle Habits (Smoking, Sleep, Water intake).

Data use: Used to calibrate the recommendation engine (e.g., specific advice for specific ethnicities).

The Face Scan (Biometric Ingestion):

Input: Camera capture (Selfie).

Security: Display BIPA/Privacy Consent Popup before camera opens.

Processing: Image sent to backend (AI Vision model) to analyze features.

2. 🧠 The "System" Logic (Backend Analysis)
The Core Algorithm: The backend must process the Survey + Scan to generate a "Face Potential Score" (0-100) and a "Looksmaxing Plan."

Target Features to Detect (The "Flaws"): The AI must explicitly look for and tag:

Face Fat / Face Bloat

Eyebrow Shape (Weak/Bad)

Acne / Skin Texture

Hair Style Suitability

Skin Tone (Pale/Dullness)

Teeth (Yellow/Crooked)

Eye Bags / Dark Circles

Sclera Color (Yellowish/Red)

The "ROI" Sorting Engine: Recommendations must be sorted by Return on Investment.

Logic: Priority Score = (Aesthetic Impact) / (Time & Effort Cost)

Example: Whitening teeth strips (High Impact / Low Effort) = Rank 1.

Example: Jaw surgery (High Impact / Extreme Effort) = Rank 10.

3. 🖥️ Application Architecture (Tabs & UI)
Tab 1: The Report (Home)

Header: User's "Face Potential Score" and Current Level.

Body: Scrollable list of "Quests" (Recommendations).

Organization: Sorted by Priority/ROI (Immediate fixes first).

Detail View: Clicking a specific issue (e.g., "Face Bloat") opens a drawer with:

Action items (e.g., "Drink 4L Water", "Low Sodium").

Product Recommendations (Affiliate placeholders).

Daily Habits to add.

Tab 2: Progress (The Gallery)

Layout: "Before & After" slider comparison.

Constraint: User must take a monthly selfie.

UI Helper: When taking a new selfie, overlay the original selfie as a semi-transparent "ghost" guide to ensure same angle/lighting.

Tab 3: Scan & Calibration

Function: Allow user to retake Survey or Face Scan.

Logic Gate: "One Free Redo." If the user messes up the first scan, they get 1 free retry. Subsequent retries are locked (Premium feature).

Tab 4: Tasks / Calendar (The Quest Log)

View A (Daily): Checklist of daily habits generated from the Report (e.g., "Mewing 30 mins", "Skincare Routine").

View B (Calendar): Monthly view of adherence.

Gamification: Completing tasks grants XP. XP levels up the user's Avatar.

Tab 5: Profile (Hunter Info)

Display: User Avatar, Level, Settings.

Consultations: "Meeting Scheduler" button integration (WebView or API link to Calendly) for 1-on-1 coaching.

4. 💰 Monetization Architecture
Build the app with these placeholders ready:

In-App Ads: Reserved slots in the Report feed for native banner ads.

Premium Subscription: Boolean flag in database is_premium.

Removes Ads.

Unlocks "Advanced Advice" (e.g., Peptides, advanced dermatology).

Unlocks unlimited Scans.

Product Sponsorships: The "Product Recommendation" slots in the Report tab must be dynamic (editable via backend).

Skins/Themes: Avatar customization options locked behind "Premium" or direct purchase.

Consultations: Payment gateway integration for the $5 live consults.

5. 🛡️ Priorities: Security & Legal
Medical Disclaimer: Sticky footer on ALL Report screens: "Not Medical Advice. Consult a professional."

Data Encryption: All images stored in Private Buckets (Supabase Storage).

Vulnerability Protection: Inputs must be sanitized (prevent SQL injection).

6. 🛠️ Tech Stack (Mandatory)
Frontend: React Native (Expo) or Next.js PWA.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Solo Leveling Theme).

Backend: Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage).

AI: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision (via API Route).
